# Food-Assessment-Quality
Problem Description The food inspection department conducts regular inspection on food quality for various restaurants in the city. Itâ€™s a very well documented procedure and over time some good amount of data has been generated out of these inspections.   The inspection department would like to predict where they should focus most in terms of their next inspection schedule, so that they can most optimize their time at hand to catch the worst offenders. Can the past inspection or any data that they have collected predict which facility will pass or fail.  In this hackathon, MachineHack provides you with a subset of this dataset with information on food quality checks conducted on thousands of facilities that serve food across multiple cities. Your objective as a Data Scientist is to predict whether a facility will pass or fail the inspection based on a number of factors.
